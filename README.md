## by JL (lipabass@gmail.com)

This repository contains simple, training projects I have created during courses and bootcamps.

## Table of content
* Python 3.9.7
 * Lotto Generator

   My very first project in python. Generates desired number of 6 unique, random number sets, and saves them in "wyniki lotto.txt".

 * Guessing Game

   First assigment from the Perian Data 2022 Complete Python Bootcamp. Player has to guess the number between 1 and 100.
   The game tells, whether each guess is closer to the target than the previous one. It also tells whether the first guess
   is closer, or further than 10 from the target.

 * Guessing Game 2

   Added some improvements to the original Guessing Game:
   * a plot showing player's path to guessing the mystery number
