# TicTacToe

This project started as a bootcamp assignment. Originally the requirements were pretty minimal:

>Here are the requirements:
>
>    * 2 players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer)
>    * The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
>    *You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol >     on the board

Some of the features I have added since then:

  * ##### Winner detection
  The game tells whether a player has won, or the final result is a tie.
  * ##### Artificial player
  Still in development, but it's playable
  * ##### User move validation
  * ##### Bigger board  display  

More to come!
